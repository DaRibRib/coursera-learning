	<h1>Learning HTML from Coursera</h1>
	<h3>My journey so far on the Coursera (course) on HTML, CSS and Javascript</h3>
	<section>
		<h2>Think this was Lecture 05 - on div and span elements.</h2>
		<div>Learnt about div tags and <span>span tags as well.</span>
		Hopefully I'm learning something about it...</div>
		<div>The div tags are used for block content- meaning that it must be on a line on its own 
		<span>(unless there's a span tag)</span>
		- which now roughly translates to the current flow content. Whereas the span tags are for in-line content, now roughly equating to the phrasing content.
		</div>

		<h2>Something on semantic elements - Lecture 06 if I had to guess</h2>
		<article>Semantic means something that adds to something else to ADD more informaion or logic...</article>
		<article>Also learnt about the article element.</article>
		<article>ALSO learnt about the section element, and now have formatted eveything to include sections to make HTML neater and more presentable.</article>
