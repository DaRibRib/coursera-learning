	<h1>Learning HTML from Coursera</h1>
	<h3>My journey so far on the Coursera (course) on HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h3>
	
	<br>
	
	<section>
		<h2>Think this was Lecture 05 - on div and span elements</h2>
		<div>Learnt about div tags and <span>span tags as well.</span>
		Hopefully I'm learning something about it...</div>
		<div>The div tags are used for block content- meaning that it must be on a line on its own 
		<span>(unless there's a span tag)</span>
		- which now roughly translates to the current flow content. Whereas the span tags are for in-line content, now roughly equating to the phrasing content.
		</div>
		<aside>Note: The words "tag" and "element" mean the same thing and can be used interchangeably.</aside> 
	</section>

		<h2>Something on semantic elements - Lecture 06 if I had to guess</h2>
		<div>Semantic means something that adds to something else to ADD more informaion or logic...</div>
		<div>Also learnt about the article element.</div>
		<div>ALSO learnt about the section element, and now have formatted eveything to include sections to make HTML neater and more presentable.</div>
		<aside>
			Note: Made former article tags on lines 31-33 turn into div tags - because you need a header tag within it to be a proper article. What W3C says about it:
					"The article element should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site."
		</aside>

		<h2> Different kinds of lists - Lecture 7</h2>
		<div>For unordered lists, you must use the ul tag(just means Unordered List), and for everything you put inside of it, you add the li tag.</div>
		<div> So, for example, here are the reasons why you should join the course I've enrolled in:
			<ul>
				<li>Its free</li>
				<li>It's a step-by-step process for all beginners in:
					<ul>
						<li>Hyper-Text Markup Language</li>
						<li>Cascading Style Sheets</li>
						<li>JavaScript</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>It has good reviews...</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>You can also make ordered lists with the ol tag. It's basically the same formatting and code like the unordered lists, but it puts stuff in a specific ORDER(1, 2, 3, etc.). Don't forget to put the li tag within...
		</div>

		<h2>Probably lecture 8 because the last thing I did was lecture 7 - HTML character entity references</h2>
		<div>So in HTML, you weirdly can't use some characters you could usually use on your keyboard
		<span>(like "greater than", "less than" and "and" symbols)</span>
		So you are forced to use codes in order to denote these symbols.
		<span> (Also used for stuff which isn't on the reglar everyday keyboard, like the &copy; symbol.)</span> 
		</div>
		<div>Here are the CHARACTER ENTITY REFERENCES you need to know for the more common stuff:
			<ul>
				<li>&lt; -- &amp; l t ;</li>
				<li>&gt; -- &amp; g t ;</li>
				<li>&amp; -- &amp; a m p ;</li>
				<li>&copy; -- &amp; c o p y ;</li>
			</ul>
			<aside>Note: If you put these characters together, it would create the desired symbol, so I spaced them out so that didn't happen. When actually coding, remember to put these together.</aside>
		</div>
		<div> Also found out about character reference to wrap text together (essentially meaning that the words will always stay together even if you shrink the page). Could use this to link words&nbsp;with&nbsp;special&nbsp;meaning together. In order to do so, take away the space between the words and add "&amp; n b s p ;".</div>

		Not gonna lie, the instructor could've made a more hands-on approach but it's fun nonetheless...
		<span> Also, learnt this on lecture 06~</span>
